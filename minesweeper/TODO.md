- create tests
- rename scripts in `scripts`
- autodetect
  - offsets
  - dimensions
- configure formater/linter
- fix calculated step, because it's not working properly
- X piptools
- X pyproject.toml
- use __all__ in __init__s
  - adapt imports
- use @property for properties instead of get/set manual methods (kinda the same thing tho)
- often a custom Error is raised instead of ValueError - look into that
- add @unique to Enums if applicable
